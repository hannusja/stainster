Stainster is an app for Histotechnology student working on special stain practicum.

Idea: Transform staining protocols into easy to follow step-by-step recipes with timers and check marks. I am also planning to add options to calculate necessary chemicals volumes based on number of slides to be stained and glassware size used.

Disclaimer: Most likely I will not include actual staining info into this repository for it might contain proprietory or restricted information. However I will try to demonstrate all the functionality on a demo data.
